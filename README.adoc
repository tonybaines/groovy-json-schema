JSON Schema DSL
===============

JSON Schema is a useful tool to me, especially when regression testing APIs, but it suffers from some redundancy
and little tool support.

This is an attempt to make the job of building a schema for validation purposes a little easier.

= Goals
* To be able to generate valid JSON schemas the cover off my validation use-cases
** Primitive types (optional/mandatory)
** Arrays (constrained size)
** References to other definitions (JSON schema and/or DSL ?)


= Features
* IDE support for completion and highlighting (Intellij IDEA certainly)
* Validation of the generated schema
* Build-tool support
** Gradle
** Maven (maybe)
